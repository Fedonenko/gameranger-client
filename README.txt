Gameranger client
Version 0.5
7/28/05
------------------------------------------------

Windows:
Open the gameranger.dsw or gameranger.sh, depending on if you have visual studio.net or visual studio 6. Then just compile and build it like normal.

Linux:
Issue the command 'make', and that's it.

Mac:
Issue the command 'make'. You'll have to create a .app package. You can read on Apple's site for more information.




wxWidgets Instructions:

Visit http://www.wxwidgets.org and download the latest stable distribution. 


Linux: 

./configure
make
make install

That should do a default installation of the wxWidgets libraries, headers, etc,.

Windows:

go to the src directory where you installed wxWidgets, and open wxWindows.dsw. Then just build all.



Usage:

Run the application, and go to the menu "Accounts". From there you will be able to register a new account, or login with a previous one. The rest is pretty self explanatory.
